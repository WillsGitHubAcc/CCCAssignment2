Real time stream = v1.1 API
therefore: 
use credentials1.json for VM 1 (both harvester and server), 
and credentials2.json for VM 2
(both twitter api keys are kenneth's, but they only let you use v1.1 api with these)

Use credentials3.json for VM 3 (kenneth's v2 api key)
and credentials4.json for VM 4 (william's v2 api key)
